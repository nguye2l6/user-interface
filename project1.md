# Project 1: Recording the Journey
## Design work-
### Interviewing
### Sketching
### Feedback
## Describe your interface in detail:
Explain the features and controls
Include plenty of screenshots to illustrate your interface and different actions users can perform within it
Explain how you implemented this application (libraries, code structure....)
## Future work- No project is ever fully done. What would you do next?  This is also a place to discuss the work you attempted but could not fully complete before the project deadline- include screenshots to illustrate and document your progress. 
## Include a 2-3 minute demo video, showing your interface in action. 
The easiest way to record this is with a screen capture tool, which also captures audio- such as Quicktime.  Use a voiceover to explain your application.  Include the name of the project, your name, the project components, and how your application works.  You can present it on your webpage or on youtube, but it must be linked on your webpage. 
## Include a link to your source code on github and a link to the publicly hosted application.
