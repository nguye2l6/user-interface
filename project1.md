# Project 1: Recording the Journey

The goal of this project is going through the design process of creating a tracking application that addresses users needs. In particular, the tracking metrics are focused on cardio/health related processes. Currently, the application allows users to track their weight, heartrate, number of steps, and times of activity.

## Design work-
### Interviewing
#### What do you hope to learn from these interviews? 
Prior to implementing and designing the application, useful things to learn is the modality that users prefer tracking, how often they track, and how detailied they would want to track their information.
#### What questions did you ask?


#### What did your interview participants tell you?  What did you learn from them?



### Sketching
For sketching, there were three general phases, 10 minutes of preliminary sketches, 10 minutes of refinement, and continously work on final sketch.

### Feedback
Feedback 1: Sketching


## Describe your interface in detail:
Explain the features and controls
Include plenty of screenshots to illustrate your interface and different actions users can perform within it
Explain how you implemented this application (libraries, code structure....)
## Future work- No project is ever fully done. What would you do next?  This is also a place to discuss the work you attempted but could not fully complete before the project deadline- include screenshots to illustrate and document your progress. 
## Include a 2-3 minute demo video, showing your interface in action. 
The easiest way to record this is with a screen capture tool, which also captures audio- such as Quicktime.  Use a voiceover to explain your application.  Include the name of the project, your name, the project components, and how your application works.  You can present it on your webpage or on youtube, but it must be linked on your webpage. 
## Include a link to your source code on github and a link to the publicly hosted application.
